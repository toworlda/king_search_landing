        Chosen Palette: Calm Neutrals & Deep Teal (Shades of gray, off-white #f8f9fa, with a deep teal #0d9488 accent for interactive elements and highlights). For FAQ, added vibrant but harmonious background colors for visual appeal.
        Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a top navigation bar for smooth scrolling to thematic sections. The structure tells a story: 1. Hero section introducing the project's significance. 2. A "Project Overview" highlighting core strengths. 3. A deep-dive into the "King Search Project" with an interactive module explorer. 4. "Tools & Commands" showcasing specific integrated tools and their command counts and other features. 5. "The Opportunity" section combining Bangladesh's cyber-readiness challenges with global market growth data. 6. "Target Buyers" outlining ideal customer profiles in an interactive tab format. 7. "Commercial Model" explaining the unique one-time sale proposition and support structure. 8. A "Pro Edition Release" section for exclusivity and contact. 9. A comprehensive FAQ section using an accordion for usability, now with enhanced visual appeal. This narrative flow is more engaging for potential buyers and stakeholders than a linear report.

                        One Of The Most Significant Bottlenecks In Cybersecurity Today Is Fragmentation. Professionals Often Juggle Dozens Of Tools, Each With Unique Configurations, Outputs, And Limitations. This Scattered Approach Slows Down Workflows And Increases The Risk Of Missed Vulnerabilities. King Search Tackles This Challenge Head-On. It Eliminates The Need For Separate Tools By Offering An Integrated, Autonomous Framework Where Modules Are Purpose Built, Not Externally Patched Or Borrowed. Each Of The 50+ Modules Is Self-Powered, Meaning It Handles Everything From Scanning To Exploitation And Reporting Internally and Don'T Rely On External Dependencies Or User Prompts. They Are Built With The "Hacker Sir Logic Flow" That Mimics How Elite Attackers Think, Pivot, And Escalate In Real-World Scenarios.
